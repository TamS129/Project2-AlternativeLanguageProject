&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In this Alternative Language program, the language I choose to implment is C++ version C++20. The reason I chose this programming language over other C based languages was due to it's ability to work within classes and allow a somewhat simular feel to Java with it's setup. However, I would learn quickly that C++ has a lot of differences between the language. Which has sadly left the project in it's current unfinished state. 

   &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; C++ in terms of it's functionally can handle Object-Oriented Programming, file Injestion, conditional statements, assignment statements, loops, and subprograms (functions/methods). C++ fully supports object-oriented programming. It provides features such as classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation. Developers can define classes, create objects, and use access specifiers (public, private, and protected) to control access to class members. 
   
   C++ handles file operations through its standard library. Specfically using the <fstream> library, which includes ifstream for reading from files, ofstream for writing to files, and fstream for both reading and writing. C++ also supports conditional statements using if, else if, else, and switch constructs. These statements enable the execution of code blocks based on specific conditions, providing a way to handle decision-making in the program.  Assignments in C++ are performed using the = operator. C++ also supports compound assignment operators like += and -= for more concise expressions. Functions in C++ are defined using a return type, a name, and a parameter list. C++ supports both free functions (outside of any class) and member functions (methods) within classes. Functions can be overloaded based on their parameter types and numbers. C++ supports several types of loops, including for, while, and do-while. These loops enable repetitive execution of a block of code as long as a specified condition is met.
